# Lazy Plugin Loader for Obsidian

Load plugins with a delay on Obsidian startup, so that you can get your app startup down into the sub-second loading time.

**Important:** Please note that it may take up to 2 restarts of Obsidian for all the settings to work correctly, if it's the first time you're using the plugin. This will only be an issue after the very first install.
